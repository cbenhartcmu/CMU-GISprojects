This is my portfolio for the Advanced GIS class!

# About Me
I love GIS, mapping for equity, makeup, gluten free food, reading thrillers, music, horror comedies, and shih tzus. I hope to work in an equity-related job, hopefully incorporating GIS because maps are a beautiful explanatory tool.

# What I hope to learn
Transferable and impressive mapping skills! I already have a degree in Regional Planning with a concentration in land use and cartography, so I would like to do a deeper dive and work with as many mapping platforms as possible.
